# Engineering
The powerhouse of the ~~cell~~ station.

## Concept
Engineering is the department responsible for constructing, powering, and maintaining the station and its equipment, keeping it functional and usable by the crew. In addition, engineering may also process or synthesize materials

It is extremely fun and rewarding for players to solve a mechanical issue or build something new for other players. As such, Engineering and its mechanics should promote collaboration, cathartic solutions, and above all, the feeling that the player's actions are making a difference.
